### Course Plan

Here is a more concrete plan of the mystical 4 Chapters we prepared for
you. These are the highlights of each part.

* __Chapter One__ – What is Haskell, what are its particularities, basic Haskell
  syntax, functions, types, expressions.
* __Chapter Two__ – FP concepts in the language, immutability, pattern matching,
  recursion, polymorphism, laziness, Higher-ordered functions, partial
  applications, eta-reduction.
* __Chapter Three__ – Focus on Types. Type aliases, ADTs, Product types and
  Records, Sum types and Enumerations, Newtypes, Typeclasses.
* __Chapter Four__ – Kinds. Three monsters of functional programming: Functor, Applicative,
  Monad.
